//! Centralized error handling for deft.
//!
//! A single concrete error enum keeps things flat and pragmatic. Every
//! fallible operation in deft returns `Result<T, DeftError>`. We deliberately
//! avoid a trait-object based error hierarchy; a rich sum type is clearer and
//! lets call sites `match` on exactly what went wrong.
